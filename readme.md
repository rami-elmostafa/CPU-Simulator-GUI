# CPU Scheduling Simulator - CS 3502 Project 2

### Kennesaw State University
### Operating Systems - Spring 2025

---

## üìö Overview

This project simulates various CPU scheduling algorithms, providing a visual interface and performance metrics comparison.  
It was developed as part of CS 3502: Operating Systems coursework.

The following CPU scheduling algorithms are implemented:
- First Come, First Served (FCFS)
- Shortest Job First (SJF)
- Priority Scheduling
- Round Robin (RR)
- **Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF)** ‚≠ê (new)
- **Highest Response Ratio Next (HRRN)** ‚≠ê (new)

## üöÄ Features

- User input for number of processes, arrival time, burst time, and priority.
- Calculates and displays:
    - Average Waiting Time (AWT)
    - Average Turnaround Time (ATT)
    - CPU Utilization (%)
    - Throughput (processes per second)
- GUI built with Windows Forms (C#).
- Basic performance graphs/tables included in project report.
- Starter code forked and extended from: [CPU-Simulator-GUI Starter Code](https://github.com/FrancisNweke/CPU-Simulator-GUI)
